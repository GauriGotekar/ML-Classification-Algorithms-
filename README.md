Problem statement: To predict the diagnosis of cervical cancer (through cervical biopsy) by assessing the risk factors associated with cervical cancer.

A cervical biopsy is a procedure to remove tissue from the cervix to test for abnormal or precancerous conditions, or cervical cancer. An early screening can help the potential patient detect cancer earlier or identify cells 
which have the potential to turn into cancerous cells. A cervical biopsy may be done when abnormalities are found during a pelvic exam. The features using which 
this predication can be made are demographic, habitual and historical medical records of the women surveyed. These features can be identified as ‘risk factors’ 
for developing cervical cancer.

The dataset comprises 36 columns of respondents' age, medical history and habitual patterns. Our target variable here 
is the 'biopsy', which can detect the possibility of the occurrence of cervical cancer. The dataset also contains variables such as Hinselmann, Cytology and 
Schiller. These are different screening methods to diagnose or detect the presence of cancerous cells around the cervix. These variables can also be framed as the 
target variable, but here we consider cervical biopsy as the target variable.
